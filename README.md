# 3kh0.github.io replit

This branch is for deploying the site with replit. Still a work in progress, this might be moved to it's own repository later.

> **Warning**
> **This is not the orginal repo! This is only for replit deployments! The original can be found [here](https://github.com/3kh0/3kh0.github.io)**


## Run on replit

Have a blank node.js repl on replit at the ready and run the following command. This automatically configures this branch as the local branch and only tracks this branch.

```bash
git clone -b replit --single-branch git@github.com:3kh0/3kh0.github.io.git
```
